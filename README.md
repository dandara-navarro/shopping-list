## Project Features

1 - This app will display a text input for the user, where they will be able to write a shopping item. Eg. "a dozen eggs", "detergent".

2 - A button to add new item to Shopping list should be displayed beside the input. When clicked, this button should add the user's input to a list of shopping items.

3 - Users should be able to add items to the list by using the "Enter" key as well.

4- Blank items should not be added to the list. This can happen if the user presses the add button or clicks enter without writing down a task.

5 - The list could potentially have 0 to multiple items.

6 - After adding an item, the text input must be emptied automatically.

7 - Each list item must display the shopping item name and a button labeled "delete".

8 - When clicking on the delete button, the list item should be removed from the list.

## Future Features

1 - Display a timestamp for each added item.

2 - Allow ordering the list by timestamp, ascending and descending.

3 - Allow sorting items by drag and drop. (For more advanced programmers who are already comfortable with React). You may use external libraries if you wish to do so.
